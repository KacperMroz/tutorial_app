# Flutter Tutorial

In this tutorial i will try to show you how to create a simple flutter app. Tutorial will be divided into several parts. 
Each part will be in separate branch. Your tasks are named tutorial/part-x. I'll try to attach examples of solutions to each task in branches named solution/part-x.

During the tutorial i will left you TODOs. You can find them in your IDE in TODO tab.

## Getting Started

First of all take a look on a simple Figma project. 

[Figma - link](https://www.figma.com/file/Pepi76GQVyE0BubSH7Cd9y/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=14VWVW28590mSx9G-1)

I've created for you a simple structure of a project. Get used to it.
In addition i've created a theme files which i want you to use in this project (lib/theme).
In the beginning we will use Navigator to navigate between screens, it is also done.

## Part 1 - Login screen

Your first task is to create UI of a login screen. You can find it in Figma project.
Do not provide any logic for now. Focus on perfect layout, and think if some of created widgets could be reused in the future.
If you are ready push your changes to the repository. After positive code review you can go to the next part.
